# All Active Directory Labs I've Completed on THM

## Attacktive Directory...

## Active Directory Basics

In this lab, I was introduced to the basics of Active Directory, a directory service that allows for centralized management of user and computer resources in a Windows domain environment.
Prior to completing this lab I worked in Help Desk in a small IT department along side a Network Engineer. We worked on many different projects and he taught me alot about active directory(users,groups,computer). Completeing this lab was fairly easy since its the basics but I gain valuable information on a number of information I didnt know.

The lab began with an introduction to the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and the different components that make up a Windows domain. I learned how to create user accounts, groups, and organizational units (OUs) in Active Directory and how to manage these resources using the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) tool.

Next, the lab dove into the different types of group policies that can be implemented in Active Directory, including password policies, account lockout policies, and computer policies. I was able to experiment with these policies and understand their impact on the Windows domain environment.

Overall, the Active Directory Basics lab on TryHackMe provided a comprehensive overview of Active Directory and its various functions. I highly recommend this lab for anyone looking to gain a foundational understanding of Active Directory.

Until next time‚úåüèΩ
